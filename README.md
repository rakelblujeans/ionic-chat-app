Super simple chat app using Firebase as the backend

We use Firebase as the backend. The tutorials I saw online were somewhat out of date, so I decided to write my own. I wrote this app in about 2 hours. It's not fully tested on device.

The app lets users sign up using a email/pass (Firebase auth), and lets the user pick their display name. Once you're logged in, you can create a new chat room or join an existing one.

Once in a chat room, users can view and post messages.
